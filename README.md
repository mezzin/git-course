# git-course
A git repo with exercises for my git course.


This repo contains some commits and branches set up to simulate some common
scenarios one can meet when managing a software project hosted in a git
repository.

It may also contain the slides for the presentation too in the future.


## DISCLAIMER:

The git history/branches on this repo are meant to allow practicing some
exercises, it looks ugly and it's supposed to look like this!
